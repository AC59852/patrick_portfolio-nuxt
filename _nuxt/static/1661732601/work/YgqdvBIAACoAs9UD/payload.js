Most responses proved that many users have multiple forms of social media as well as one or more music streaming services.\n\nThe comparative analysis I conducted identified the main pain points user’s encountered with social and music related applications, accessibility issues, examples of fully accessible content, opportunities Song Charter could pursure, as well as helping define features users value including, social features, profile customization, listening history, and music recommendations.","research_slice$74e32f24-92a1-4de9-949c-f2ab1490bce3","The Design Process ",962,542,"A combination of wireframes, prototypes, and the information architecture for Song Charter","https:\u002F\u002Fimages.prismic.io\u002Fpatrick-bradley-portfolio\u002F3d1aff19-fd99-4287-b14e-4c5618b6c51c_songcharter_design.png?auto=compress,format","I started out designing the information architecture according to the layout of other social platforms. From the survey, most users preferred having a navigation menu to switch between content easily and separating the application into 5 separate sections allowed users to have full control over the navigation of the app. \n\nThe low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes also allowed me to conduct a usability test which helped mold a simple design where the application could become user-centric and focus on the main needs and values of each individual user. Profile customization is a great example of this, and the usability testing showed users enjoyed being able to edit and arrange content on their own profile according to their personal preferences.","research_slice$8eef372b-5681-46a3-9345-53fcc16c660c","The Final Product",1204,677,"3 High-Fidelity prototypes for Song Charter (the home page, the search page and the profile page)","https:\u002F\u002Fimages.prismic.io\u002Fpatrick-bradley-portfolio\u002F6658c4a4-d750-41b0-babc-211fe16b46fb_songcharter_final.png?auto=compress,format","The final design consists of 5 sections, a homefeed, a search section, a posting feature, a notification section, and a profile page.\n\nReviews and ratings from accounts users are following show up in the newsfeed. The newsfeed is an excellent way for users to find recommendations from other users as well as comment on every post to agree or protest another user’s personal music opinion.\n\nThe search section was designed for users to be able to find new music, artists, reviews, and other users. In this section, users are also able to add songs and albums to their own library, also called their ‘listenlist.’\n\nThe post section is where users are able to create a review for a song or album, which then shows up on both their own profile and the homefeed of those who follow that user.\n\nThe notification page is where activity from each user’s profile is shown. New followers, comments, likes, and a user’s follower’s liked reviews will also show up in the notification page. \n\nThe profile page is one of the main draws of the app. From profile customization such as editing a user’s favourite albums to changing a profile or cover photo, the profile section is designed for users to be able to display their musical tastes as well as a personal profile theme.\n","research_slice$5f7c2162-4263-41b1-8c11-5858e58286e7")));
