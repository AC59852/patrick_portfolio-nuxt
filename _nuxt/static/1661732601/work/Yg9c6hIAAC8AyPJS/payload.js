The end design solution came in form of simple user interactions. With multiple ways for users to interact with content on the site, the combination of smooth animations and high-quality design contrasts perfectly and users are able to freely and easily navigate throughout.\n\nFinally, colour contrast was a major aspect of my design process. I wanted a way to distinctly display each project and presenting the content over bright colour gradients and pastel backgrounds helped establish the projects as the main focus of each page. Users were able to navigate freely while also being subtly lured in to view each project on the site.\n\n",spans:[]}],slices:[{variation:d,version:e,items:[{ProcessImage:{dimensions:{width:i,height:j},alt:a,copyright:a,url:k},ProcessContent:[{type:b,text:l,spans:[]},{type:c,text:m,spans:[{start:n,end:o,type:p}]}]},{ProcessImage:{dimensions:{width:q,height:r},alt:a,copyright:a,url:s},ProcessContent:[{type:b,text:t,spans:[]},{type:c,text:u,spans:[]}]},{ProcessImage:{dimensions:{width:v,height:w},alt:a,copyright:a,url:x},ProcessContent:[{type:b,text:y,spans:[]},{type:c,text:z,spans:[]}]}],primary:{title:[{type:b,text:A,spans:[]}]},id:B,slice_type:C,slice_label:a},{variation:d,version:e,items:[],primary:{researchTitle:[{type:b,text:D,spans:[]}],researchImage:{dimensions:{width:g,height:h},alt:E,copyright:a,url:F},researchDescription:[{type:c,text:G,spans:[]}]},id:H,slice_type:f,slice_label:a},{variation:d,version:e,items:[],primary:{researchTitle:[{type:b,text:I,spans:[]}],researchImage:{dimensions:{width:g,height:h},alt:J,copyright:a,url:K},researchDescription:[{type:c,text:L,spans:[]}]},id:M,slice_type:f,slice_label:a},{variation:d,version:e,items:[],primary:{researchTitle:[{type:b,text:N,spans:[]}],researchImage:{dimensions:{width:O,height:P},alt:Q,copyright:a,url:R},researchDescription:[{type:c,text:S,spans:[]}]},id:T,slice_type:f,slice_label:a}]},workUID:"12345678"}],fetch:{"PageFetch:0":{slices:[{variation:d,version:e,items:[{ProcessImage:{dimensions:{width:i,height:j},alt:a,copyright:a,url:k},ProcessContent:[{type:b,text:l,spans:[]},{type:c,text:m,spans:[{start:n,end:o,type:p}]}]},{ProcessImage:{dimensions:{width:q,height:r},alt:a,copyright:a,url:s},ProcessContent:[{type:b,text:t,spans:[]},{type:c,text:u,spans:[]}]},{ProcessImage:{dimensions:{width:v,height:w},alt:a,copyright:a,url:x},ProcessContent:[{type:b,text:y,spans:[]},{type:c,text:z,spans:[]}]}],primary:{title:[{type:b,text:A,spans:[]}]},id:B,slice_type:C,slice_label:a},{variation:d,version:e,items:[],primary:{researchTitle:[{type:b,text:D,spans:[]}],researchImage:{dimensions:{width:g,height:h},alt:E,copyright:a,url:F},researchDescription:[{type:c,text:G,spans:[]}]},id:H,slice_type:f,slice_label:a},{variation:d,version:e,items:[],primary:{researchTitle:[{type:b,text:I,spans:[]}],researchImage:{dimensions:{width:g,height:h},alt:J,copyright:a,url:K},researchDescription:[{type:c,text:L,spans:[]}]},id:M,slice_type:f,slice_label:a},{variation:d,version:e,items:[],primary:{researchTitle:[{type:b,text:N,spans:[]}],researchImage:{dimensions:{width:O,height:P},alt:Q,copyright:a,url:R},researchDescription:[{type:c,text:S,spans:[]}]},id:T,slice_type:f,slice_label:a}]}},mutations:void 0}}(null,"heading2","paragraph","default-slice","sktwi1xtmkfgx8626","research_slice",962,542,273,155,"https:\u002F\u002Fimages.prismic.io\u002Fpatrick-bradley-portfolio\u002F6a03b63c-1d11-43c8-b92e-fc6e8ffc9362_identify3.png?auto=compress,format","Identify The Problem","We wanted to showcase our collaborations, but our portfolios would become cluttered.",0,84,"em",258,181,"https:\u002F\u002Fimages.prismic.io\u002Fpatrick-bradley-portfolio\u002F08b971bf-9f08-4a8e-9224-a4cda79e8567_research3.png?auto=compress,format","Define Web Principles","User Interaction\nColour Contrast\nEasy Site Navigation",259,193,"https:\u002F\u002Fimages.prismic.io\u002Fpatrick-bradley-portfolio\u002F5f8e1929-71e3-4059-b08e-60d67252187a_design3.png?auto=compress,format","Design","Wireframing\nPrototyping\nInteraction Design","The Process","process_slice$37b3eae4-0525-4ec0-8a9f-4815196f237e","process_slice","The Research","A colour wheel used to help select the best possible gradients for AP Creative's projects.","https:\u002F\u002Fimages.prismic.io\u002Fpatrick-bradley-portfolio\u002F0046e3af-6a5f-45f7-910e-0f3feb90b0c0_apcreativeresearch.png?auto=compress,format","Once our team had analyzed the data we collected, I began working on the information architecture. I found patterns and differences between each participant's card sort and thus, created the information architecture.\n\nI then started on low-fidelity wireframes, creating the structure of the website. The data our team had collected from the survey, interviews, and card sort, proved that user’s like to see both images and descriptions of the food they are purchasing, and because of this, prioritizing menu images and detailed descriptions were the most important part of designing the structure of the wireframes. Utilizing design heuristics to create an accessible UI was also a high priority for the wireframes.\n\nFinally, prototyping the low-fidelity mockups to use during the usability testing phase was my next priority. Using Figma I created a scalable prototype where users were able to engage with the structure and “feel” of the website without any detail. The prototypes also helped our team analyze and adjust features and functions that user’s liked and disliked to improve the overall experience of the app.","research_slice$1b46542e-036e-4e05-a608-0f53d9ea728b","The Design Process","A high-fidelity prototype for the AP Creative website.","https:\u002F\u002Fimages.prismic.io\u002Fpatrick-bradley-portfolio\u002F78de0579-356b-428a-91e5-5544d88c89af_apcreativedesign.png?auto=compress,format","After the card sort had helped determine the basic structure of the app, I designed the information architecture, focusing on ease of use and accessibility.
